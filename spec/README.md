# Specs

Plain-language behaviour specs for the engine. Each spec passed the scrub pipeline in [PROVENANCE.md](../PROVENANCE.md) (sections 2–4) before it was committed here. Implementer sessions read specs; they never edit them, except to add requests under `requests/`.

## How a spec arrives

1. The spec agent drafts it in its own workspace, or answers a request from `requests/`.
2. Lint, then a fresh scrubber session, then sign-off by the project lead.
3. The lead commits it as `spec/<topic>/S-xxxx-short-name.md` with `spec: add S-xxxx <title>`.

A spec that contradicts a measurement goes back for revision; the measurement wins. Revisions bump `revision` and go through the same pipeline.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `<topic>/S-xxxx-*.md` | One spec per file, grouped by game topic |
| `TEMPLATE.md` | The spec template |
| `glossary.md` | Our own vocabulary for game concepts (to be written with the first specs) |
| `requests/` | Spec requests (`Q-xxxx`) from implementer sessions |
| `incidents/` | Incident logs (`I-xxxx`), see PROVENANCE.md section 8 |

Topics: `simulation`, `combat`, `movement`, `production`, `economy`, `structures`, `infantry`, `vehicles`, `aircraft`, `naval`, `superweapons`, `special-abilities`, `visibility`, `rules-import`, `formats`, `rendering`, `triggers`, `ui`. Add a topic when a spec does not fit; never organise by the original program's modules.
